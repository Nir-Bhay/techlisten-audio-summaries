## 🎬 Judge Q&A Preparation

### Technical Questions

**Q: How does the AI extract structured data?**
> "We use GPT-4 twice: first for conversation, then for extraction. A second API call analyzes the chat history and returns structured JSON with validated fields."

**Q: How do you ensure data privacy?**
> "All data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Users can delete portfolios anytime. We're GDPR compliant and never train on user data."

**Q: What about scalability?**
> "Current architecture handles 1K concurrent users. We plan Redis caching, load balancing, and MongoDB sharding for 100K+ users."

---

### Business Questions

**Q: Why not use existing builders?**
> "Existing builders require design decisions. We eliminate that with AI. Plus, we're 10x faster and role-optimized."

**Q: How do you acquire customers?**
> "SEO-optimized content, LinkedIn ads targeting job seekers, partnerships with bootcamps, and viral sharing (powered portfolios link back)."

**Q: What's your moat?**
> "Conversational AI quality and template intelligence. As we grow, our data improves recommendations - network effects."

---

### Product Questions

**Q: What if AI makes mistakes?**
> "Users can always edit directly in the chat or manually. We also show confidence scores and offer regeneration."

**Q: How many templates?**
> "We launch with 5 templates, each optimized for different professions. Pro users get early access to new templates."

**Q: Can users customize further?**
> "Yes! Pro tier includes custom CSS editor and API access to inject custom sections."
